# Soumyajeet's Learning Hub ðŸ“š

Welcome to my personal Learning Hub! This is a compilation of all my projects, notes, and learning progress in full-stack development. It includes my journey learning the MERN stack, NEXT.js, NEST.js, Java, AWS, Redux, Redis, DSA & DBMS.

## Features:
- **Projects**: Browse through all my completed and ongoing projects, categorized by technology.
- **Notes**: Detailed documentation of my learning progress for various technologies, including code snippets and examples.
- **Learning Timeline**: Follow my progress and milestones in different areas of development.
- **Tech Stack**: Built with React (or Next.js), Node.js (or Nest.js), and MongoDB.

## How to Use:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-learning-hub.git
   cd my-learning-hub

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    
    
## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Nest.js
- **Database**: My SQL
- **Deployment**: AWS
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Caching**: Redis


## Project Structure:
- **/public**: Static assets like images and icons.
- **/src/components**: Reusable UI components (e.g., navigation, footer, project cards).
- **/src/pages**: Main pages for the site (Home, Projects, Notes).
- **/backend**: Backend logic for handling dynamic content and MySQL integration using Nest.js.
- **/data**: JSON data for projects and notes (or connected to a MySQL database).

## Future Updates:
- Add more detailed notes on AWS, Nest.js, and advanced topics like DSA.
- Implement search functionality to navigate through notes and projects.
- Add authentication and an admin dashboard to easily update notes.
