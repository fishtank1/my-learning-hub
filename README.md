# my-learning-hub
Soumyajeet's Learning Hub is a web app that organizes your projects, notes, and resources. It showcases completed and ongoing projects, detailed learning notes (MERN, NEXT.js, Java, AWS, etc.), coding challenges, and DSA problems. You can categorize notes and track learning goals and milestones.
